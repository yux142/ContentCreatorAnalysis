### What is the status quo of content creators on a video sharing platform?

The number of content creators on a streaming platform in China reached a peak in recent years with a total of over 20 million+ active creators and an increase of 600k+ each month. However, while the growing speed of the quantity is optimistic, we want to take a deeper look at the quantity of the content creators. Furthermore, like other video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, creators with different size fan bases could be diverse; and the status for creators with varying topics of video could also be different. Therefore, in this project, we want to understand the status quo of the platformâ€™s content creators with various features and analyze the differences.
