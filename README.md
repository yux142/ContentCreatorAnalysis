### What is the status quo of content creators on bilibili.com (video sharing platform)?

While bilibili.com has become the Chinese young generation’s favorite video sharing platform, the number of its content creators reached a peak in recent years with a total of over 20 million+ active creators and an increase of 600k+ each month. However, while the growing speed of the quantity is optimistic, we want to take a deeper look at the quantity of the content creators. Furthermore, like other video-sharing platforms such as YouTube, creators with different size fan bases could be diverse; and the status for creators with varying topics of video could also be different. Therefore, in this project, we want to understand the status quo of bilibili’s content creators with various features and analyze the differences.
